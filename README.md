# Parduotuve

Basic Laravel website. 

Home page includes information about the product, product description and a order form created with Bootstrap Modal after ordering, order info email is sent to the buyer.

Second page is the all orders data displayed with DataTables plugin for Laravel.

For front end I used bootstrap examples to speed up the front end creating. Pictures slideshow is created via Bootstrap Carousel. 
For form validation I used jquery validation plugin, because I wanted to display errors inside of bootstrap modal.

The data table has button column which makes the order complete or incomplete. When order completion button is clicked buyer gets an email informing about the completion.
